To run : 
1. Make a gpu enabled env/venv.

3. pip install requirements.txt
4. Check the run.py file for general training and sampling example(s).

DataLoader class implements functions to load your own txt file, merge all txt files in a source directory into a single file and split an input data file into train and val files
Additionally, If you're a stranger and found your way here, I assume you're here because you're interested in language models. Instead of a readme, I think you should explore the code yourself, 
which could help in you getting a better understanding of how they work :). Cheers
